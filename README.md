#### In this Task we are using Titanic dataset including name feature, but with a little bit changing in the target. we consider the label in this task not Survived like in the famous competition but Sex.So the task is predict the gender of the passangers.

I want to see the effects of processing the text on changing the accuracy. For that, i will use some simple features of NLP to process Name texts.


You can see all results with all descriptions in my Kaggle account: [Kaggle/YoussefAlsoufi/Titanic_Gender_Lablel](https://www.kaggle.com/code/youssefalsoufi/titanic-gender-label).

### Also Tuning Hyper parameters with using Titanic_Survived_Labe is presented in this link : 
[Kaggle/YoussefAlsoufi/Titanic_Survived_Label](https://www.kaggle.com/code/youssefalsoufi/tuning-hyper-parameters-titanic-survived-label). ‚úåüèº

##### where, In this script we will use Random and Grid search techniques to tune the Hyper parameters of the algorithms of ML.
